# LiepajaTourGuide
Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Project 6 - Tour Guide App

Multi-Screen Apps

Goal of the project:

create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user who’s
visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public 
places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets 
that only locals know. It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, 
as well as what information to provide in each category.

Skills to learn from this project:

* Planning your app design and navigation before coding
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
* Building layouts to display those lists of data
* Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager
* Creating your own custom classes
* Properly handling images or audio (if applicable).
